          <h1>Project Management:</h1>
          <p>
            Following industry best-practises I have completed various proposals
            for new Projects. I have experience completing Project Briefs
            including RACI charts, budget proposals, estimates, testing plans,
            and accessibility reports. Additionally, I have conducted research
            on industry leading SAAS in an effort to find the most efficient
            methods for team monitoring and project completion.

          <p>
            My experience with Graphic design is present throughout this
            website. Working within the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, I have
            produced a collection of impactful designs (including the logo
            heading this very site). I have knowledge on the design process
            including wireframing, moodboards, and style guides. I have also
            completed original vector based artworks and poster designs.
