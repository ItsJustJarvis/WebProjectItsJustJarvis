        <p>
          Although I have just begun my journey into web and mobile app
          development, it feels like second nature to me. I have been able to
          achieve much more than I had anticipated in my first year of studies.
          I have excelled in all of my courses, and will continue to work hard
          towards a successful career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you can find examples of the work I have completed thus far, and
          I will be updating it regularly. I invite you to follow along with my
          progress, and observe the results of my determination to succeed in
          this industry.

        <h1>Project Planning & Management:</h1>
        <p>
          Following industry best-practises I have completed various proposals
          for new Projects. I have experience completing Project Briefs
          including RACI charts, budget proposals, estimates, testing plans, and
          accessibility reports. Additionally, I have conducted research on
          industry leading SAAS in an effort to find the most efficient methods
          for team monitoring and project completion.

        <h1>Development and Programming:</h1>
        <p>
          Though new to development and programming I have excelled at
          completeing many projects. I have experience in environments including
          Visual-Studio, Eclipse, and MySQL workbench. Working with HTML, CSS,
          SQL and Java I have completed various Web-Sites, Databases and
          Programming Projects. I plan to expand my repetoire of coding
          languages as I continue through my development program and into a
          career in the tech industry.

        <h1>Graphic Design:</h1>
        <p>
          My experience with Graphic design is present throughout this website.
          Working within the Adobe Creative suite, I have produced a collection
          of impactful designs (including the logo heading this very site). I
          have knowledge on the design process including wireframing,
          moodboards, and style guides. I have also completed original vector
          based artworks and poster designs.
