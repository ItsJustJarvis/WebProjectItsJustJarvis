          <p>
            This one should come as no surprise to those of you that know video
            games. This is widely regarded as one of the best games of all time,
            and for good reason. From start to finish Ocarina of Time captivates
            you with a powerful story, interesting new locations, and one small
            boys inspirational quest to save the world. I had no trouble
            choosing this as one of my top three and will continue to replay it
            for years to come.

          <p>
            This game was revolutionary in its time and changed the first person
            shooter genre forever. Utitilizing the offset-stick controller of
            the original xbox, it brought a new aspect of control that had
            rarely been seen before. This game is fundamental to my love of
            video games, and will always hold a place in my top 3. The story was
            mindblowing to me, and the level design was way ahead of its time. I
            can not count the amount of memories I have playing this exceptional
            game.

          <h1 class="title">Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic</h1>
          <p>
            Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic is the first entry in a widely
            loved game series. The rich story telling that takes place in this
            game, is something that comes once a decade in video games. Bioware
            is one of my favourite developers and this may just be their
            masterpiece. As you work towards becoming a Jedi, you gain exciting
            new powers and encounter some shocking twists along the way. The
            game has become a cult classic, and has earned its place in my top
            three.
