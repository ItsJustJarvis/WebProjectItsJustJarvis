        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I've always dreamed of being a developer...</p>
        <p>
          For a long time I have been interested in tech. My whole childhood, I
          spent my time diving into interesting new worlds through video games.
          It served as an escape from all the pressures of modern life. I grew a
          passion for technology the second my hands touched the controller. I
          am excited to start my career in tech to take that passion further,
          and bring exciting new ideas to our world.

          Currently studying in the Web and Mobile App Development Diploma
          program at NIC. Graduating Spring 2022.

          Kayla is my best friend and life partner. She is one of the strongest
          women I have ever known, and has been such an essential part of my
          growth as a person. We have had many adventures over the years, and
          we've lived in some beautiful places. I can't wait to see what else
          life has in store for us.

        <p>
          Archie is my best friend, and sidekick. We rescued little archie from
          overseas in November 2019. He is my first dog, and I don't know what
          I'd do without the little guy. He is a silly boy, and likes to sing
          when hes bored.
